          Riding a motorcycle is thrilling, but even the most reliable bikes can
          run into issues. Knowing how to diagnose and fix common problems can
          save time, money, and stress. Here are a few handy tips to keep your
          bike running smoothly:

          Engine Won’t Start: If your motorcycle isn’t starting, check the
          basics first—fuel level, kill switch position, and whether the bike is
          in neutral. A dead battery is often the culprit, so test it with a
          voltmeter or try jump-starting. Also, inspect the spark plug for signs
          of wear or carbon buildup. Poor Performance or Power Loss: If your
          bike feels sluggish or loses power, it could be due to a clogged air
          filter or fuel line. Clean or replace the air filter regularly and
          ensure there’s no dirt in the fuel tank or lines. Carburetor bikes
          might need tuning, while fuel-injected ones may need a throttle body
          cleaning.You can also check out our app and rent a bike: Ontrack App |

          can indicate loose parts, worn-out chains, or low engine oil.
          Regularly check for loose bolts, lubricate the chain, and maintain
          proper oil levels to avoid serious damage. Braking Issues: Spongy
          brakes or decreased stopping power can result from air in the brake
          lines or worn-out brake pads. Bleed the brakes and inspect the pads
          for wear. Always use the recommended brake fluid. Overheating:
          Overheating can damage the engine. Ensure there’s enough coolant and
          that the radiator is clean. In air-cooled bikes, avoid long idling and
          keep fins clean. You can also check out our app and rent a bike:

        <p>
          Regular maintenance, timely inspections, and listening to your bike’s
          behavior are key to preventing major breakdowns. When in doubt, always
          consult a mechanic—it&#39;s better to be safe than stranded!
